      <h1>The workshop</h1>
      <p>
        For as long as I can remember, we made our jewelry within
        the confines of my home. It started in a spare bedroom,
        then more people started joining that I had to relocate.
        I had the garage overhauled to accommodate the team, and
        it has been a great journey since then.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bead-making.jpg" alt="Making beaded jewelry" class="popout">
      <p>
        We grew to a scale that none of us had anticipated. Over
        the years, we've listened to countless tales of your lives,
        and we've taken those stories to heart over and over again.
        And now, we are able to take a huge step in our journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing out of a tiny bedroom, our team has now moved
        into this humble studio. It's filled to the brim with
        tools and materials, waiting to be turned into something
        new. To us, this place is more than just a workshop; this
        is a playground! We experiment with different techniques,
        refine our craft, and most importantly, we have fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's thanks to the people who support our journey that
        we're able to keep this dream of ours alive. This
        community that we fostered together empowers us to
        continue delivering, giving, sharing all of these
        memories and moments with all of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never imagined that something I started as a love
        letter to one person would turn into a way for
        people around the world to show their own love. I'm
        truly grateful to everyone. Russel, the team, our
        community, all of you.

      <h1>I've always loved the moon</h1>
      <img src="/images/moon-necklace.jpg" alt="De Lune" class="popout">
      <p>
        Back in high school, I always took late night walks. My
        parents used to tell me not to go because it can be
        dangerous at night, but look at me. At first, I didn't
        know the exact reason as to why I leave every after
        dinner. Maybe I enjoy the breeze, or maybe I wanted
        away from the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        There aren't many cars at night. Since the area isn't
        that well-illuminated, the vehicles that do pass by are
        quite slow. Meaning I'd be pretty brave at walking around,
        even without a phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep finding myself at this basketball court. I don't play,
        it's just that it's the only place I know with very little
        trees. As much as I love trees, I want to look up and see
        the sky. Some nights were cloudy, and I couldn't see a thing.
        But other nights were clear, and might I say magical.
      </p>
      <p>
        A week into this habit, I realize I only go outside just so
        I can take a good look at the nightscape. The millions of
        stars embracing a singular moon, it's beautiful.

      <h1>When I least expect it.</h1>
      <p>
        I look back to when I was younger, I didn't believe in
        Santa. I knew early on what cartoons and fairy tales
        were, so my family never had the opportunity to fool me.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/little-girl.jpg" alt="Little girl" class="popout">
      <p>
        On my 8th Christmas, my mom had the bright idea of hiding
        my present. I was really excited then, so when I found out
        it was missing, I bawled. But I'm a strong girl, so I got
        up right away and started looking for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked everywhere &mdash; the kitchen, the backyard, the
        living room, even underneath the toilet seat (ew). Finally,
        I got to my bedroom, and guess who I saw.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was <strong>the</strong> Saint Nicholas. I saw Santa
        Claus. I never would have thought I'd believe in someone's
        existence so much until him. I started bouncing like a
        little child (to be fair, I was), and began apologizing
        for not believing in him. You know what, he forgave me.
        It was one of the best Christmases I've ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
        12 years later, I'm a little wiser now. In hindsight,
        the Santa in my memories looked a lot like my dad. He was
        very muscular for someone who always had cookies and milk,
        not to mention he left the house using our family's car.
        But now, even that won't stop me from believing. Santa is
        real, and I feel myself turning into a little girl again
        every Christmas day.
